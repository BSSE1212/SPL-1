Waiting (protikkha)

   I have time now--

              When will you have time?

        I have arranged the evening lamp--

              When will the flame burn him?

   I have come down to understand everything,

              I tied the boat to the dock--

   I left all the way to find,

              Buy and sell in different markets.
